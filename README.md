In this project, I did exploratory data analysis about subway turnstile in New York City. Turnstile data were taken from MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) which provides public transportation service in New York City. The aim is to find out busiest stations, days and time intervals in a day. 

Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, arcgis modules were used in the project.
