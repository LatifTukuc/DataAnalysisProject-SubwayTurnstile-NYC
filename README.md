In this project, I did exploratory data analysis about subway turnstile in New York City. Turnstile data were taken from MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) which provides public transportation service in New York City. 

Actually, this is a case study. There will be an event in New York City in the last week of June 2023. Street teams will be in subway stations, and they will get e-mail addresses from people to sell the event tickets. The aim is to optimize distribution of street teams and make them get as many email addresses as possible. Therefore, I tried to find busiest stations, days and time intervals in a day.

Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, arcgis modules were used in the project.
